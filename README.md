## **GIS & Frontend Developer** | ReactJS

I am so passionate about web programming and always trying to improve myself. I care about doing my work in time and fast, focusing on solutions, communicating clearly, and being
cheerful while working. I am never afraid of learning something new. I can work as Frontend Developer React and Next JS. I know a little backend and server site. I want to get an
internship with an ambitious organization that helps me transfer my knowledge and get new experience. I can work remotely and I have experience with that.
